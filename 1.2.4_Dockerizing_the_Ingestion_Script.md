In this session, we need to convert the jupyter notebook into a python script

In order to ensure that we have successfully copied the csv to the database. We are going to delete all of the rows in
the database

```postgresql
delete from yellow_taxi_data
```

Run the python script with the args

The script is also design that if there are no args inserted then it will not continue.

[Python script](src/week1/ingest_data.py)

```shell
python3 src/week1/ingest_data.py \
  --user=root \
  --password=root \
  --host=localhost \
  --port=5432 \
  --db=ny_taxi \
  --table_name=yellow_taxi_data \
  --url=https://github.com/DataTalksClub/nyc-tlc-data/releases/download/yellow/yellow_tripdata_2021-01.csv.gz 
```
