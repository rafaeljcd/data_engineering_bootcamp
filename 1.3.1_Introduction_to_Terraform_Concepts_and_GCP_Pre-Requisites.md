## GCP setup

### GCP setup service account and authentication

After the account creation, this is the steps we must do

![](https://i.imgur.com/w9aEKrV.png)

1. Create a project on GCP, and after the creation select that project to switch into that project.

   ![](https://i.imgur.com/1u3MOKo.png)

   The `Project ID` must be unique to all of GCP

   ![](https://i.imgur.com/dOoU9Bx.png)

   Then wait for the notification that indicates that the project have been created.

2. Now click the hamburger button on the left side, and then click `IAM`

   ![](https://i.imgur.com/IZo60mL.png)

3. Now click the `Service Accounts`, and then select `Create Service Account`.

   `Service account` is a special kind of account used by an application or compute workload, such as a Compute Engine
   virtual machine (VM) instance, rather than a person. A service account is identified by its email address, which is
   unique to the account.

4. Now we need to fill up the details for the `Service Account`. This doesn't need to be unique id because this in
   combination with email of your project will make it unique.

5. Now, next step is to give it a `viewer` role. But this is only at the beginning.

6. Next up, this part is useful for the production environment if you want multiple user associated with the same level
   of permission. But for this course we will skip this part. Now we must click `done`

7. Now that the service is account is created, you can see that there is no keys in there. To create key go to
   the `Actions Kehab menu` and then select `Manage Keys`

   ![](https://i.imgur.com/KedSPrL.png)

8. Select the `Add Key` and then select `Create new key`.

   ![](https://i.imgur.com/Kvc6dNk.png)

   Then select the `JSON` so we can read the file and possibly edit the file, and then select `create key`

   ![](https://i.imgur.com/zHoC8rV.png)

   After the key was created, it will then be saved into your local computer. We must keep this key.

### Setup GCP CLI

To set up the GCP CLI we must follow the steps.

1. Go to this website https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install#linux

2. Now do the following shell commands.
   
   Download the file
   ```shell
   curl -O https://dl.google.com/dl/cloudsdk/channels/rapid/downloads/google-cloud-cli-415.0.0-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
   ```
   
   Extrac the file.
   ```shell
   tar -xf google-cloud-cli-415.0.0-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
   ```
   
   Now run the installation shell
   ```shell
   ./google-cloud-sdk/install.sh
   ```

3. Check if it is installed properly by running
   ```shell
   gcloud -v
   ```

4. Now we must log in our account by running this following command.
   ```shell
   ./google-cloud-sdk/bin/gcloud init
   ```

5. Now you must proceed to log in.

   Afterwards you will be prompted to log in using the link given.

6. Copy-paste the link to the browser, and then click your own account with the GCP.

   ![](https://i.imgur.com/Jc3oCKm.png)

   Now we must give the CLI the permission to the account.

7. Now we will be redirected to the page, where we will copy the verification code.

8. Paste the verification code to the terminal, and then wait for it to log in. After the login, select the project ID

9. Afterwards, your GCP CLI is now connected to your google account and the project.
